SCRIMBA COURSES

I am currently taking and planning to complete various courses on Scrimba, an interactive learning platform that aligns with my hands-on learning style. My goal is to pursue a career as a junior front-end developer, and to demonstrate my coding proficiency, I actively complete the exercises provided in each course. This approach allows me to build a comprehensive portfolio that showcases my skills and understanding.
